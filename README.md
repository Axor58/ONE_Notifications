<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ONE Notifications

ONE Notifications is a script for the FiveM ESX Framework that enables users to create custom notifications and alerts for their servers. With this script, server owners can create a wide range of notifications, such as alerts for when players enter or exit certain areas, notifications for when players purchase or sell items, and even custom messages to welcome players when they join the server.

The script is designed to be easy to use, with a simple configuration file that allows server owners to customize the notifications to their liking. The notifications themselves can be displayed in a variety of ways, such as through pop-up messages, chat messages, or even audio alerts.

One of the key benefits of ONE Notifications is that it helps server owners create a more immersive and engaging experience for their players. By providing custom notifications and alerts, players are more likely to stay engaged and invested in the game, which can help increase player retention and satisfaction.

Overall, ONE Notifications is a powerful tool for server owners who want to create a more dynamic and engaging gameplay experience for their players. With its customizable notifications and alerts, this script is a must-have for any FiveM server looking to stand out from the crowd.

Here's why:
* ONE Notifications is a FiveM ESX Framework script used to create custom notifications and alerts for servers.
